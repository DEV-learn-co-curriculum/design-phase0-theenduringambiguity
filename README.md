# What is a UX Designer? #
> ## A holistic, multidisciplinary approach to the design of user interfaces for digital products, defining their form, behavior, and content. User experience design integrates interaction design, industrial design, information architecture, information design, visual interface design, user assistance design, and user-centered design, ensuring coherence and consistency across all of these design dimensions.
> – Pabini Gabriel-Petit, UX Matters.

User experience (UX) design means different things to different people. In fact, if you ask three people to define what UX is, you will likely hear three different answers. However, most everyone will agree that someone in UX design role is primarily concerned with the total experience of a user as they interact with a product or service that is meant to a specific user problem. UX consists of users, content, business goals and how the users interact with the material.

### [UserTesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/ui-vs-ux/) defines UX designer this way: 

> UX designers are responsible for ensuring that the company delivers a product or service that meets the needs of the customer and allows them to seamlessly achieve their desired outcome. UX designers work closely with UI designers, UX researchers, marketers, and product teams to understand their users through research and experimentation. They use the insights gained to continually iterate and improve experiences, based on both quantitative and qualitative user research."

Since its growing popularity in the late 2000s, UX has been adopted by different markets. Jobs now range from generalist UX design positions to highly-specialized UX roles in larger companies. It's important to note that how a company views UX will likely dictate the job of their staff UX designers. In other words, wherever a designer works, an [agency](https://kubixmedia.co.uk/blog/what-is-a-creative-agency-and-what-do-we-actually-do/), a [startup](https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2013/12/16/what-is-a-startup/#22eee3f64044), an [in-house](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/in-house.asp) company or a [consultancy](https://uxdesign.cc/being-a-design-consultant-objective-and-expectation-996940d03eb6), will determine precisely what role they take on at that company.

### For example, at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), the Experience Designers are comprised of interaction, visual and service designers:
> What we design goes beyond the screen and impacts all aspects of our users' journey (hence the name Experience Design). Sometimes we design small adjustments to a page or flow, sometimes we’re designing wholly new product experiences. Both have a big impact. We are all hybrids and we work at all stages of the product process—from concept to launch—in collaboration with researchers, product managers and engineers. The work is challenging. It stretches us to think online and offline and embrace all cultures." — Katie Dill, UX Designer from Airbnb, 2015.

### Google tend to be more specialized and focus on product focused UX patterns:
> [Google] UX Designers on a daily day basis design interfaces navigation models UX patterns for a lot of different apps and surfaces... I helped change the UI in a way that's more usable and more efficient to users... — Sun Park, User Experience Designer from Google, 2017

### [The Value of Design Thinking in Business](https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/design-thinking-business-value)
by [James Pikover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespikover) CEO of Voltage (8 min read) Great design is simple, beautiful, and easy to use. It creates a sense of purpose and place. It responds to user needs, and it just works. Aside from these characteristics, how can we know whether a design is “good”? Moreover, how can a business know whether the investment of time and money into a design was worth it? [Read more](https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/design-thinking-business-value)

by [Anish Joshi](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/anish-joshi-00634a1) Head of Design and Innovation at [Shell](https://www.shell.com/) (6 min read) Many people in the world and business still see ‘Design’ as that thing which makes things look good, function well, and perhaps have an emotive quality. Recently (although in reality it has been in the public arena for at least a decade now) there has been the emergence of the term, tool, discipline, and mindset, that is ‘Design Thinking’. ‘Created’ and coined by Tim Brown of IDEO, (see my other blog, [‘Dangerous Times in Design’](https://medium.com/@AnishJoshiDesign/dangerous-times-in-design-8651844b8bcd), if you want the definition/ know what it is) it was a nice power move to make; affording designers a whole new playground and application of their skills, and executives a seemingly original angle at which to approach their business problems with. Since then it has slowly gathered favor and momentum, but its use and users have constantly been changing… [Read more](https://uxdesign.cc/design-thinking-isnt-design-it-s-design-thinking-b8a5f96f0294)

by [Adam Leon](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/transmitterstudios) Design & Technology Strategist at [Transmitter Studios](https://cx.transmitterstudios.com/home)(6 min read) Design Thinking. Specific definitions vary and they all include a problem solving process that puts identifying people’s needs first using a variety of tools to achieve results. This is my favourite part. Getting the results. Too often in our industry of software and services we consider that an individual transaction is the end of an association. It shouldn’t be. Digital solutions are not one-off billboards. Iterations, experiments, observations, insights, and action drive real change and create valuable products.
