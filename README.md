# The Enduring Ambiguity

> ## The greater the ambiguity, the greater the pleasure.
> – Milan Kundera


Knowing what you know now, you’ll agree that there is a lot of grey area when it comes to talking about UX and UI design. There are a range of jobs available that are anywhere from focused in on certain aspects of one type of design or the other, to broader and more inclusive of pieces from each type of design. The good news is that with all of this ambiguity, if you get a well-rounded education in all of the areas that interest you, a best-match job will definitely be there for you to apply to.
Visual design is fairly non-specialized. Someone who considers themselves a visual designer will have a foundation in graphic design and branding but can also create User Interface designs for the digital and physical space. They likely have knowledge and experience in UX, too. 

Here’s a breakdown of the design world’s more specialized positions: 


# Visual Designer 

This is more broad than specialized but a visual designer has foundation ins graphic design, branding but can also execute on user interface designs for the digital and physical space. A visual designer many times have knowledge and experience in user experience as well, especially when it comes to the user journey that touches on marketing.

# Interaction Designer (IX) 

Kind of like a visual designer or UI designer, but an interaction designer focuses on the motion aspects of the product. They are constantly asking and make decisions about questions like, What does the transitions look like? What are the micro-interactions that make the brand memorable?

# Information Architect (IA) 

A specialized designer that has a broad understanding UX but focuses specifically on content and how it presents to the user. To structure it for the user, information architects organize content using site maps and label systems. 

# Experience Architect (XA 

Experience architects are fairly new to the design scene. In their day-to-day, they have a hand in many design aspects, including user experience, interaction design, information architecture, design research, content management, project management and application development. To be successful, they must have a firm understanding of design, human behavior writing and even computer science. They are comparable to Product Designers and some UX Designers in certain markets. 

Take it from Wikipedia, which [says](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Experience_architecture) that XA are "responsible for connecting human emotions with the end product thus creating co-relations by ensuring that the experience meets or exceeds needs and objectives of the intended or wide users." 

# Experience Designer (XD) 

Experience Designers are interested in the ideas, emotions and memories created when people and brands connect. As holistic problem solvers, XD’s evaluate entire brand ecosystems to design an experience across all channels that delivers results during every interaction. 

Though this role sounds similar to a UX Designer, an XD looks at the user’s journey with a brand in a broader sense, instead of considering only the user’s digital connections with a brand. XD’s often design live events which require them to think about how the user will experience a brand with all five senses -- not just the two senses triggered by a digital interaction.

The XD Agency [says](https://xdagency.com/ux-vs-xd/): "A brand creating a mobile app needs UX. A brand putting on an activation needs XD. User Experience is the more specific discipline; Experience Design is the broader one."
