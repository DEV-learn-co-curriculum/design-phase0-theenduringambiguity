Knowing what you know now, you can easily agree there is a lot of fuzziness when it comes to talking about UX and UI design. There are jobs that focus on specialized aspects of an UX designers' responsibilities. There are jobs that have pieces from one specialization with another. We've broken some of it down below but if you get a broad education in the areas that interest you, the job will be there for you to apply to.

### Visual Designer ### 

*   This is more broad than specialized but a visual designer has foundation ins graphic design, branding but can also execute on user interface designs for the digital and physical space. A visual designer many times have knowledge and experience in user experience as well, especially when it comes to the user journey that touches on marketing.

### Interaction Designer (IX) ### 

*   A variant of a visual designer or UI designer. A interaction designer focuses on the motion aspects of the product. What does the transitions look like? What are the micro-interactions that make the brand memorable?

### Information Architect (IA) ### 

*   A specialized designer that has understanding of the broad user experience but focuses on the content and how it's structured for the user. Information architects organize content by means of  site maps and language and label systems. 

### Experience Architect (XA) ### 

*   Experience architects, a fairly newer term, encompass several interdisciplinary focuses including user experience, interaction design, information architecture, design research, content management, project management, and application development. This means this designer is a true expert in design, human behavior, writing and even computer science. This role is comparable to Product Designers and some UX Designers in certain markets. 
*   Wikipedia explains it well when it says XA are "responsible for connecting human emotions with the end product thus creating co-relations by ensuring that the experience meets or exceeds needs and objectives of the intended or wide users."

### Experience Designer (XD) ### 

*   Experience Design looks at all touchpoints between people, brands, and the ideas, emotions, and memories that these moments create. As holistic problem solvers, XDs must look at an entire brand ecosystem and ask: “How can I orchestrate an experience in a way that delivers results across all channels and touch points?" 
    
*   Though this role sounds exactly like what an UX Designer would do, an experience designer focuses on more than the digital touch point and looks at that broad user's journey. Many times, an experience designer is focused on live events and thinks about all five senses of the experiencer, not just the two for user in the digital interface space. 
*   The XD Agency summarizes this well: "A brand creating a mobile app needs UX. A brand putting on an activation needs XD. User Experience is the more specific discipline; Experience Design is the broader one." [https://xdagency.com/ux-vs-xd/](https://xdagency.com/ux-vs-xd/)
